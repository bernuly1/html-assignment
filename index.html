      "Just play.Have fun.Enjoy the game."

      "I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take
      the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed."

    <p>Regarded by most as the NBA's greatest all-time player, Michael Jordan won six titles with the Chicago Bulls.
      His total playing salary during his career totaled $90 million, but he has earned another $1.4 billion (pre-tax)
      from corporate partners.
      Jordan bought a majority stake in the Charlotte Hornets in 2010 for a grossed-up value of $175 million.
      The Hornets are now worth $1.05 billion with Jordan owning 90% of the team.
      In addition to Nike, Jordan still has sponsorship deals with Hanes, Gatorade and Upper Deck 15 years after hanging
      up his hightops.
    </p>
    <p>
      In my opinion, Jordan is the greatest player of all time. He exceled in the offensive, defencive and transition
      aspects of the game.
      Michael holds many world recodrs (untill this day) and was the first gold medal in the olympic basketball games as
      an NBA player(The Dream Team).

      <p class="ans">1.The differences between the web versions
        <ul>
          <li>web 1.0
            It is the “readable” phrase of the World Wide Web with flat data. In Web 1.0, there is only limited
            interaction
            between sites and web users.
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Has static pages and web sites. The search is not very accurate and update of the data is not so frequant.

            <li> Frames and Tables used to position and align the elements on a page</li>
          </ul>

          <li>web 2.0
            It is the “writable” phrase of the World Wide Web with interactive data. Unlike Web 1.0, Web 2.0 facilitates
            interaction between web users and sites, so it allows users to interact more freely with each other.

              Web access leads to concern different, from the traditional Internet user base to a wider variety of
              users.
            </li>

          </ul>

          <li>web 3.0
            It is the “executable” phrase of Word Wide Web with dynamic applications, interactive services, and
            “machine-to-machine” interaction.
          </li>

          Use case
          </br>
          </br>
          </br>
          A user wants to search a guitar shop.
          </br>
          </br>
          Results:
          </br>
          <li>
            Web 1.0
            The search results would probably be sites that have guitars (not necessarily selling them) and maybe shops
            that don’t have guitars. It will also show some links to guitar shops, not necessarily next to the user.
          </li>
          <li>
            Web 2.0
            The search results would probably be sites about guitar shops and links to sites that connected to the
            guitar shops.
          </li>
          <li>
            Web 3.0
            The search results will have elements that react to information about the user. Guitar shops that are
            located next to the user will appear first as well as pictures and social pages of the shops.
          </li>
        </ul>
